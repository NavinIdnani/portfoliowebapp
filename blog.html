                    <h2>A Content Model Is Not a Design System</h2>
                    <p>But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people
                        and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect
                        related content. I recently had the opportunity to lead the CMS implementation for a Fortune 500 company. The client was excited by the benefits of an omnichannel content strategy, including content reuse, multichannel marketing,
                        and robot delivery—designing content to be intelligible to bots, Google knowledge panels, snippets, and voice user interfaces. A content model is a critical foundation for an omnichannel content strategy, and for our content to
                        be understood by multiple systems, the model needed semantic types—types named according to their meaning instead of their presentation. Our goal was to let authors create content and reuse it wherever it was relevant. But as the
                        project proceeded, I realized that supporting content reuse at the scale that my customer needed required the whole team to recognize a new pattern. Despite our best intentions, we kept drawing from what we were more familiar with:
                        design systems. Unlike web-focused content strategies, an omnichannel content strategy can’t rely on WYSIWYG tools for design and layout. Our tendency to approach the content model with our familiar design-system thinking constantly
                        led us to veer away from one of the primary purposes of a content model: delivering content to audiences on multiple marketing channels. </p>

                    <p>Lastly, web development is one of those disciplines that “where there’s a will, there’s a way” definitely rings true. It’s one of those areas where, if you’re willing to put in the work, the rest usually takes care of itself. Whether
                        you’re an experienced developer, or a newbie, there’s always something new to learn or practice. Among the best out there is David Walsh, who works for Mozilla. David places practice above theory in order of importance. He believes
                        that developers should never fear experimentation and always be willing to dabble in unknown areas. He’s also a stern believer in the fail-fast Agile methodology. We’ve actually included his blog in the list below! You can become
                        more adventurous by reading up on all subject matters relating to the art of web development. And trust us when we say there’s plenty of free material on the web!

                    <h2>Learn JavaScript in fun way!!</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is undoubtedly one of the best languages to learn as a developer, whether you’ve been at it for years or are just starting out. More than 97% of today’s websites are powered by JavaScript. Regardless of what field you work
                        in, you’ll likely be exposed to JavaScript at some point, as the language is firmly entrenched in the online world. But what is the best way to learn JavaScript? That’s a tough question, because what I think is the best way to
                        learn JavaScript may not be the best way to learn it for you. So the question you should ask yourself is, “What’s the best way to learn for me?” I’ve compiled the 7 best methods for learning JavaScript so you can find the best
                        way for you. I’ll show you the best methods online - and offline - and help you find the best way for you and your learning style.While understanding computer science and the theory behind programming is important, until you actually
                        write and interact with the code yourself, you might as well be sitting on the sidelines. Practicing writing code is where you build those hard skills that are so sought after by the IT world. Boot.dev does this by providing a
                        web-based portal that works alongside its courses. Here, you’ll get experience crafting and solving the problems on your own, without having to mess with external downloads. You can even practice without the courses on their site,
                        by accessing Boot.dev’s free Playground and writing your own code right in the browser! Boot.dev’s emphasis on interactivity makes it interesting, but it’s not even the best part. Boot.dev’s overall goal is to get you primed and
                        ready for a career with JavaScript. Aside from hands-on practice, you’ll also be greeted with developmental techniques that are geared towards preparing you for job interviews, as well as more specialized coding skills like functional
                        programming, making it by far one of the best ways to learn JS.

                    <h2>CONTENT MODELS THAT CONNECT</h2>
                    <p>After struggling to describe what makes a good content model, I’ve come to realize that the best models are those that are semantic and that also connect related content components (such as a FAQ item’s question and answer pair), instead
                        of slicing up related content across disparate content components. A good content model connects content that should remain together so that multiple delivery channels can use it without needing to first put those pieces back together.
                        Think about writing an article or essay. An article’s meaning and usefulness depends upon its parts being kept together. Would one of the headings or paragraphs be meaningful on their own without the context of the full article?
                        On our project, our familiar design-system thinking often led us to want to create content models that would slice content into disparate chunks to fit the web-centric layout. This had a similar impact to an article that were to
                        have been separated from its headline. Because we were slicing content into standalone pieces based on layout, content that belonged together became difficult to manage and nearly impossible for multiple delivery channels to understand.
                        To illustrate, let’s look at how connecting related content applies in a real-world scenario. The design team for our customer presented a complex layout for a software product page that included multiple tabs and sections. Our
                        instincts were to follow suit with the content model. Shouldn’t we make it as easy and as flexible as possible to add any number of tabs in the future? Because our design-system instincts were so familiar, it felt like we had needed
                        a content type called “tab section” so that multiple tab sections could be added to a page. Each tab section would display various types of content. One tab might provide the software’s overview or its specifications. Another tab
                        might provide a list of resources. Our inclination to break down the content model into “tab section” pieces would have led to an unnecessarily complex model and a cumbersome editing experience, and it would have also created content
                        that couldn’t have been understood by additional delivery channels. For example, how would another system have been able to tell which “tab section” referred to a product’s specifications or its resource list—would that other system
                        have to have resorted to counting tab sections and content blocks? This would have prevented the tabs from ever being reordered, and it would have required adding logic in every other delivery channel to interpret the design system’s
                        layout. Furthermore, if the customer were to have no longer wanted to display this content in a tab layout, it would have been tedious to migrate to a new content model to reflect the new page redesign. Illustration showing a data
                        tree flowing into a list of cards (data), flowing into a navigation menu on a website A content model based on design components is unnecessarily complex, and it’s unintelligible to systems. We had a breakthrough when we discovered
                        that our customer had a specific purpose in mind for each tab: it would reveal specific information such as the software product’s overview, specifications, related resources, and pricing. Once implementation began, our inclination
                        to focus on what’s visual and familiar had obscured the intent of the designs. With a little digging, it didn’t take long to realize that the concept of tabs wasn’t relevant to the content model. The meaning of the content that
                        they were planning to display in the tabs was what mattered. In fact, the customer could have decided to display this content in a different way—without tabs—somewhere else. This realization prompted us to define content types
                        for the software product based on the meaningful attributes that the customer had wanted to render on the web. There were obvious semantic attributes like name and description as well as rich attributes like screenshots, software
                        requirements, and feature lists. The software’s product information stayed together because it wasn’t sliced across separate components like “tab sections” that were derived from the content’s presentation. Any delivery channel—including
                        future ones—could understand and present this content.
